# advanced learning planning

- till now - here basically currently we can chat with ai reference the test and all + save history

- if someone user says plan a learning path for me #plan tag user uses - then ai will generate the roadmap based on that topic  - roadmap will contain multiple processes 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6,  every process will contain the title

- the roadmap will contain the title too and will be saved on top in  chat history
- user can create multiple roadmaps


- the roadmap will be having a dropdown  where all processes are listed sequantially
- processes will be completed it user will continue learning in same chat - ai will be having of that chat   for  taking reference how muc processes have been done

- the processes will be automatically marked as completed by ai if ai marks them correct

- the roadmap is gonna be nothing but the chat but it will take look when user completing which task

user still have to chat

if context of the process matches the chat then the process gets marked

- after completion of the process  the the roadmap will be removed atomatically  are you understanding

- for api take a look at the api - /api/law-buddy/chat use same api  and methods










- dont remove current chat feature because its fine i want it as well as the roadmap feature on top too
